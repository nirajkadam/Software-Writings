I remember having self thoughts of teaching myself python since ages now but of course it wouldn't happen due to lack of purpose/implementational-projects/motivation yada yada.

I finally forced myself to take this class at my university called CSCI 8220 Advanced Simulation where we are expected to work on Python for it's homework projects. I've been looking for a clear explanation of python as an environment to create my idea of a decent enough structure for my projects. I know I either haven't looked enough carefully (due to my lack of understanding of it) or it just doesn't exists. Either ways, I'm starting this post as a log to keep track of my learnings and hope that it ends up with a decent curation of resources/explanation of the subject.

I've been looking into various IDEs and other environment tools like conda and I'm yet to wrap my head around it. I have pretty much liked using jupyter notebook due to it's ease and flexibility of adding markdown and html in it which makes each step of the project more understandable and also gives a good gist of the approach used.

I have also tried to use Google's [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) to speed up my computations and have multiple doubts regarding its use such as giving data source access to it and many more.

I will look through each of these doubts thoroughly and hopefully complete/update this post with a clear explanation of my thoughts and findings.
